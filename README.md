This was an assignment for Advanced Mathematics for Business and Technology, a course taught by Prof. Vincent Ginis at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). It covered series (including Taylor and Fourier), dynamic systems analysis and gave a short introduction into chaos theory.  

The [assignment](https://github.com/omledufromage/Advanced-Mathematics_-_Mathematica-assignment/blob/master/Mathematica%20project.pdf) consisted of using two different datasets which were supposed to be analyzed and visualized in some way. The assignment was very free, and designed to make us familiar with the functionalities of Mathematica. My [project](https://github.com/omledufromage/Advanced-Mathematics_-_Mathematica-assignment/blob/master/Mathematica_Assignment.nb) contains an exploratory analysis and visualization of a dataset on global immunization coverage, and another on global mean temperatures.
